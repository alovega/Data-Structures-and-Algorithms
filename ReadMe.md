# Data Structures

### Linked List
```
In arrays  data is stored in contigous memory location data is stored in contigous memory location for instance if
 the first item is stored at index 10 and is of size 15 bytes the next item will be stored at location 10 + 15 + 1

But for linked list data is not stored at contigous memory location for each item in memory location linked list
 stores the value of the item and the reference or pointer to the next item which constitutes of a node
```
##### Advantages of using a lined list
```
1. A linked list is a dynamic datastructure which means memory reserved for it can be reduced or increased at run time.

2. Since Arrays require contigous memory location it is very difficult to insert or delete an item  because the
 memory location of large items have to updated. Whereas in a linked list items are not stored in contigous memory
 location therefore you can easily update or delete an item

3. Owing to its flexibility, a linked list is more suitable for implementing data structures like stacks, queues, and lists.
